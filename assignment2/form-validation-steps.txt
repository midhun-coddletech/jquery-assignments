First I created the HTML page which has the form
Then in the js file,
When the DOM is loaded we create a function for validation
created a for loop for putting values inside the age dropdown,
using hide() hided the error message div in initial state
created a function on form submit
stored each input values to variables
checked if length of each input text fields are not <0 so that it is not null,
if its <1 the error message div is shown using show()
